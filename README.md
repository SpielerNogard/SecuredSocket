# SecuredSocket
The aim of this project is to create a socket connection that can be considered secure.

For this purpose, the Diffie Hellman algorithm is used to generate a key that only the two participants can know. The Diffie-Hellman algorithm is currently not considered to be hackable because the problem of the discrete logarithm cannot be solved in the right time with current computing power.
